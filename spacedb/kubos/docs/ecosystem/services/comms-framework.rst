Communications Service Framework
================================

The hardware used to establish communication between a satellite and the ground varies wildly from
mission to mission.
As a result, KubOS provides a communications service framework which can be used by developers when
creating their specific radio's hardware service.
This framework is used to simplify the process of reading messages from the ground, forwarding them
to the appropriate internal destination, and then sending properly formatted messages back to the
ground.


.. note::

    The communications service framework is currently only available in Rust. As a result, services
    wishing to utilize the framework should also be written in Rust.

    actor "Ground Control" as ground_control
    participant "Radio" as radio
    participant "Communications Services" as comms_service
    participant "Flight Software" as software

    ground_control -> radio: 1. Send command to satellite
    radio -> comms_service: 2. Read data packets from radio
    comms_service -> software: 3. Send packet payload to appropriate service
    software -> comms_service: 4. Send response back
    comms_service -> radio: 5. Send data packet to radio with response
    radio -> ground_control: 6. Send response to ground control

Data Packets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All packets sent to/from the communication device, over the wire (or air),
will be encapsulated in several layers.

.. uml::

    @startuml

    package "Radio Protocol" {
        package "Space Packet" {
            rectangle "Payload"
        }
    }

    @enduml

The first layer will be whatever communication protocol the device requires.
For example, AX.25 is frequently used as the header protocol for radio communication.

Inside of this will be a |Space Packet| containing one of the following payloads:

- GraphQL query or mutation
- JSON GraphQL responses
- File/shell service commands or data
- Any other application data or payload which can be passed over UDP

Ground Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The communications service maintains a constant read thread which listens for messages from the
ground via the communications device. Once a message is received, the message's Space Packet
header is examined to determine the payload type. Currently the communications service framework 
supports two payload types: GrahpQL and UDP. The payload type determines how the message is 
passed on to the rest of the system.

GraphQL Payloads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a GraphQL message is received, a message handler thread is spawned. This message handler 
examines the port embedded in the message's Space Packet header to determine the internal 
message destination and then makes an HTTP POST to the appropriate service.
The handler then waits for a response (within a specified timeout duration), wraps the response 
in a Space Packet, and then sends the packet to the communications device for transmission.
Once this transaction has completed, the message handler thread exits.

    @startuml

    hide footbox

    actor Radio

    box "Communications Service" #LightBlue
        participant "Read Thread" as read

        Radio -> read : 1. Read data packets from radio
        read -> read : 2. Deframe data packets
        read -> read : 3. Reassemble data packet

        create "Message Handler" as handler
        read -> handler : 4. Spawn new message handler
        activate handler
    end box

    participant "Kubos Service" as service

    handler -> service : 5. Posts GraphQL query/mutation to service
    service -> handler : 6. Return result of query/mutation
    handler -> handler : 7. Wrap result in Space Packet
    handler -> Radio : 8. Send response packet to radio
    destroy handler

    @enduml

UDP Payloads
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a UDP message is received, a message handler thread is spawned. This message handler 
examines the port embedded in the message's Space Packet header to determine the internal 
message destination and then sends a UDP packet containing the message to the appropriate 
service. The message handler thread exits immediately after sending out the UDP packet.
UDP payloads sent from the ground to flight are intended to act as a one-way passthrough.
Any responses must be sent through the appropriate downlink endpoint.

.. uml::

    @startuml

    hide footbox

    actor Radio

    box "Communications Service" #LightBlue
        participant "Read Thread" as read

        Radio -> read : 1. Read data packets from radio
        read -> read : 2. Deframe data packets
        read -> read : 3. Reassemble data packet

        create "Message Handler" as handler
        read -> handler : 4. Spawn new message handler
        activate handler
    end box

    participant "Kubos Service" as service

    handler -> service : 5. Pass UDP packet to service
    destroy handler

Downlink Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some instances where the satellite might need to send a message to the ground without
first receiving a request for data.
An example would be when sending a periodic health-and-status beacon.

In this case, the communications service may be defined with a downlink endpoint thread (or multiple
threads if more than one method may be used for downlink communication).

Each endpoint is assigned its own UDP port and maintains a constant read thread which listens for
messages from within the satellite which should be transmitted.

When the endpoint's read thread receives a message, it wraps it up in a Space Packet and then sends
it to the communications device, via the user-defined write function.

.. uml::

    @startuml

    hide footbox

    actor "Mission application" as app
    participant "Communications Service\nDownlink Endpoint" as downlink
    participant Radio
    actor "Ground Station" as ground

    app -> downlink : 1. Send data to downlink endpoint
    downlink -> downlink : 2. Wrap data in Space Packet
    downlink -> Radio : 3. Send Space Packet to radio
    Radio -> ground : 4. Send Space Packet to ground

Configuration
-------------

Most missions tend to have a single communications device which communicates via a single uplink
and single downlink method.
However, some missions have more complex communications systems; for example, having a slower, but
more reliable downlink method for transmitting a small health-and-status beacon and then a faster,
but more error-prone method for transmitting more detailed telemetry information.

The communications service framework provides mechanisms to handle these more complex
configurations.

The service's :doc:`config.toml <../services/service-config>` file should contain the following parameters:

- ``max_num_handlers`` - (Default: 50) The maximum number of concurrent message handlers allowed
- ``downlink_ports`` - (Optional) List of ports used by downlink endpoints that send messages to the
  ground. Each port in the list will be used by one downlink endpoint
- ``timeout`` - (Default: 1500) Length of time a message handler should wait for a reply, in milliseconds
- ``ip`` - (Required) IP address of the communications service

The service which implements the framework should create a |CommsControlBlock|, which
provides the final configuration to the main communication logic.
It contains the following members:

- ``read_conn`` - This is the connection structure which is used for reading from the communications
  device, for example a UART port or UDP socket
- ``write_conn`` - This is the connection structure which is used for reading from the
  communications device, for example a UART port or UDP socket
- ``read`` - (Optional) A pointer to the function which should be used to read a message from the
  communications device
- ``write`` - A list of function pointers for all available ways that messages may be written to
  the communications device
- ``max_num_handlers`` - Should be copied from the corresponding `config.toml` value
- ``downlink_ports`` - Should be copied from the corresponding `config.toml` value or ``None``
- ``timeout`` - Should be copied from the corresponding `config.toml` value
- ``ip`` - Should be copied from the corresponding `config.toml` value

.. warning::

    If downlink endpoints are being used, the number of function pointers in the ``write`` list
    **must be equal** to the number of ports in the ``downlink_ports`` list.


Implementation
--------------

Because communication methods may vary from mission to mission, it is up to the user to create the
final hardware service/s which will be used for communication with the ground.

The service which implements the communications service framework should utilize only a single
communication device.
If multiple devices are present in the system, a service should be created for each of them.

The service should contain the following components:

- A function capable of reading messages from the communications device
  (note: this may be omitted in the case where the communications device will only be used for
  transmitting data)
- At least one function capable of writing messages to the communications device
- Initialized connection structure/s which will be used by the previous read and/or write functions
- A |CommsControlBlock| structure containing all of the communications configuration
  information
- A |CommsTelemetry| structure which will be used to gather communication statistics

It is recommended that the service also follow the guidelines for
:doc:`normal hardware services <hardware-services>`.

Some support for communicating with specific hardware devices has been provided in various
:doc:`hardware APIs <../../deep-dive/apis/device-api-guide>`.
